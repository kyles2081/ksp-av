Andrew McWilliams,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Northern and Central Mountains,"While generally safe avalanche conditions exist, there are some isolated areas where you can trigger an avalanche. Look out for and avoid places where drifting snow formed thin, cohesive slabs that rest on weak October snow. You are most likely to find these areas at high elevations on northerly and east-facing slopes, especially just below ridgelines or in a gully or couloir. Identify and avoid these slopes to reduce your chances of triggering a small but potentially dangerous avalanche.",,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Brian Lazar,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Northwest San Juan,"Most slopes are safe from avalanches, mainly due to thin or non-existent snow cover.  Some welcome snowfall is increasing the threat for avalanches on wind-loaded slopes in the alpine. New and drifting snow means you can find slopes with wind-stiffened snow on high-elevation northerly-facing slopes where you could trigger a small avalanche. Use caution traveling in steep gullies and areas close to ridgelines where going for a ride in a small slide with such shallow snow cover can be dangerous.",,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0
Dylan Craaybeek,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Snowy Elks,"You can easily trigger small avalanches on steep, wind-loaded slopes facing northwest through north to east, generally above 10,000 ft. These avalanches may be small but they can knock you off your feet and take you for a dangerous ride through a thin snowpack. To reduce your chances of triggering an avalanche avoid traveling on steep slopes where you notice wind drifting snow onto the slope. The most dangerous areas are the lee sides of ridgelines and in gullies or couloirs where wind shifting from the southwest through west to the northwest will continuously load additional snow onto a very weak snowpack.",,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1
Andrew McWilliams,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Park and Flat Top,"Snow on Sunday and Monday falls onto weak snow left from October. You can trigger an avalanche where you find recently drifted snow resting on this weak base, especially in areas that held continuous coverage of old weak snow. You are most likely to find this combination at upper elevations on northerly and east-facing slopes, just below ridgelines or in gully features. Avoid these slopes to reduce your chances of triggering a small but potentially dangerous avalanche.",,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0

Dylan Craaybeek,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Central Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Central Mountains Regional DiscussionA notable storm will impact the Central Mountains starting Saturday evening through Monday. The storm starts on a southwest flow shifting to the west promoting a zonal flow that favors the Elk and West Elk Mountains before shifting to the northwest later in the day on Sunday. This storm will start warm under a southwest flow then a cold front arrive Sunday afternoon as the flow shifts northwest quickly decreasing temperatures. This “right-side-up” storm will start warm with wet, dense snow and as temperatures decrease the snow will become colder and less dense. Normally this is a good thing as it decreases the chances for Storm Slab avalanches to develop into a major issue. In this case, the snow will quickly develop into a slab with a dense base on top of an incredibly weak snowpack on almost every slope that holds continuous snow. The weak base to the snowpack from all of our October snow has been rotting under dry weather, low relative humidity, and cold, clear nights for the first half of November. Once a slab develops on this weak layer you can expect it to be very easy to trigger avalanches. The only reason the avalanche danger remains at Moderate (Level 2 of 5) is because the size of these avalanches will likely remain small until the slab builds up quite a bit more.Hopefully, avid backcountry travelers have been taking note of slopes that currently have continuous snow coverage across them. These slopes will be the most dangerous in the coming days as a slab develops on top of an already well-developed weak layer. If you haven’t been paying close attention to snow coverage try looking through the CAIC observations page to see if the slopes you are planning to travel on or near have any images of them from the first half of November. If you have been observing and documenting this snow coverage consider submitting an observation to us even if it is just a short description of the area and a few images!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dylan Craaybeek,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Southern Mountains Regional Forecast,,"Southern Mountains Regional DiscussionSome welcome unsettled weather is currently arriving in the Southern Mountains as clouds are increasing and snow begins falling at higher elevations Saturday afternoon. The storm starts out warm with the rain-snow line hovering around 9,500 feet before lowering in elevation on Sunday afternoon. Areas in the San Juan Mountains that do well on southwest flow could see eight or more inches of total snow by Sunday. These are the areas where the avalanche danger will increase to Moderate (Level 2 of 5) above the treeline on slopes where weak, early-season snow lingers. As new snow depths increase, the potential size of the avalanche you could trigger is likely to increase as well.No avalanches were reported throughout the Southern Mountains so far this season highlighting the generally shallow and discontinuous snow coverage we currently have. For the most part, the new snow Saturday through Monday will be falling on the ground or slopes with discontinuous snow coverage basically building our snowpack from scratch. This could be a good thing depending on what the next few weeks bring as we could have a significantly less widespread weak layer than parts of the Central and Northern Mountains.Hopefully, avid backcountry travelers have been taking note of slopes that currently have continuous snow coverage across them.

Andrew McWilliams,2023-11-18T23:30:00Z,Northern Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Northern Mountains Regional DiscussionModels have decreased snowfall totals for the Northern Mountains as the storm arrives. Favored areas should see about 10 inches of snow with most areas in the four to eight inch range by Monday evening. Snow starts Saturday night in favored areas and lasts through Monday across the region. The Park Range, and to a lesser extent the Flat Tops, are still forecast to be the big winners with this storm and should see most of their accumulation on the front end of this system. Areas further to the east, like the Front Range and Summit County, see more intense snowfall on Sunday and Sunday night as the wind shifts to the north.In areas where snow begins tonight, like the Park Range and Flat Tops, the danger increases to MODERATE (Level 2 of 5) on Sunday. Across the Northern Mountains, snow is falling on weak, faceted snow from October and early November that was left on high-elevation northerly and east-facing slopes. Westerly winds will drift the new snow onto this weak base and avalanche conditions will become more dangerous quickly. Thankfully, the weak, old snow was generally confined to gully features and just below ridgelines was not very continuous across the slope. This should keep the overall avalanche size small and it is unlikely we’ll see enough snow to move beyond MODERATE (Level 2 of 5) danger.In the rest of the Northern Mountains, peak snowfall is focused more on Sunday and Sunday night. While snow totals likely won’t be high enough to raise the avalanche danger, we may add a Wind Slab avalanche problem given a widespread few inches of snow with wind. The Flat Tops may fall into this lower danger category, check back tomorrow morning to see if that area stays with the Park Range or joins the rest of the Northern Mountains. If tomorrow’s forecasts begin to increase totals for the rest of the Northern Mountains, there may be a bump in danger on Monday - although this scenario seems unlikely at this time. Areas like Cameron Pass and the Gore Range are the most likely places to see higher totals than the rest of the Front Range and Summit County areas.Keep in mind that there are still early-season conditions in the Northern Mountains and any ride in an avalanche will likely result in being carried over rocks or other obstacles. Use caution around any drifted pillows of snow you suspect are resting on weak October snow. Cracking within the new snow is an obvious sign of unstable snow and an indication to move to low-angle or wind-sheltered slopes. Many southerly-facing slopes melted back to bare ground in the Northern Mountains during the recent warm and sunny weather. Look to these slopes for safer riding as they begin to get buried.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
