Jeff Davis,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,S Mtns,You can trigger a small avalanche on a steep slope or couloir if you observe more than six inches of new or drifted snow. Northerly slopes are the most dangerous as they harbored early-season snow before this past storm. Identify and avoid slopes steeper than around 35 degrees that appear smooth and rounded. Even a small avalanche can be dangerous in early-season conditions.,,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Austin Divesta,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,Park and Flat Top,You can trigger a small avalanche where you find more than about six inches of new or wind-drifted snow. Look for and avoid textured snow that feels firm under you or cracks beneath your weight. Northerly and east-facing slopes that held snow previous to the weekend's storm will be the most dangerous. Safer riding conditions will be low-angled slopes or those sheltered from the wind. ,,4,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0
Ian Fowler,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,Northern and Central Mountains,"Although unlikely, you could trigger a small avalanche where you find continuous snow, especially if it has more than about six inches of new or wind-drifted snow. This will be more likely close to ridgelines and in shady gully features. If you find rounded pillows of snow that crack beneath you, retreat to lower-angled slopes or those sheltered from the wind.",,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Ben Pritchett,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,GM thru Elks2,"You can trigger an avalanche where you find more than around 10 inches of recently fallen storm snow on northerly or easterly-facing slopes above around 10,500 feet. Most avalanches will break around a foot deep, although one could break deeper in wind-drifted terrain features. While relatively thin, one of these avalanches could break wider than you might expect. Taking a ride in any avalanche at this time of year could end badly if it pushes you into logs or rocks.Safer travel options include low-angle slopes and terrain where the storm snow fell on dirt.",,4,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,0
Austin Divesta,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,Northern Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Northern Mountains Regional DiscussionOver the weekend, a storm hit the region, but it moved out on Monday. The Northern Mountains welcomed a sign of winter. However, most areas needed more snow to change the avalanche danger. Cameron Pass through Berthoud Pass to the Ten Mile Range received between two to six inches of snow, and the avalanche danger remains LOW in these areas. On the other hand, the Park Range received between eight to twelve inches of snow, and the new snow and winds created drifted snow at upper elevations on northerly and east-facing slopes, heightening the avalanche danger toCurrently, high-elevation northerlies and east-facing slopes are presenting problems due to the snow that has been accumulating since October and early November. The warm daytime temperatures of the last two weeks and cold nights created a faceted layer of snow. In the largest cluster of the Northern Mountains stretching from Cameron Pass through Berthoud Pass to the Ten Mile Range, more than the two to six inches of new snow was needed to create a widespread problem. However, there are still a few places that may pose a problem. Observers reported problematic slopes around Rocky Mountain National Park and Jones Pass over the weekend. These terrain features are located along the lee sides of ridges, gullies, couloirs, or avalanche chutes. It's worth noting that Wind Slab avalanches have also been added to this region but are still difficult to trigger.The story is similar to the Park Range, with northerly and east-facing slopes being the most problematic due to the lack of snow in November with the warm days and cold nights. The only difference is the amount of snow they receive over the weekend. The sheer amount of new snow and winds will more easily overload the weak layer, creating a more sensitive trigger for avalanches. These avalanches may still be small, but consider the consequences of the terrain below. Much of the near and below treeline terrain around the Park Range does not have snow on the ground or only a few inches.Outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy activities like hunting, hiking, ice climbing, or sliding on snow should be mindful of the risk of avalanches in their recreational areas. If you notice that the snow starts to support your weight and sounds hollow, you likely stumbled upon a problematic area. Even a small avalanche can have severe consequences. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution and remain aware of the potential risks involved.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jeff Davis,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,Southern Mountains Regional Forecast,,"Southern Mountains Regional DiscussionThe storm arrived warm on Saturday, and snow was slow to accumulate. Precipitation intensity picked up on Sunday afternoon and continued into Monday. The heaviest snowfall for most of the forecast area was sundown Sunday into Monday morning. Snowfall favored areas around Telluride, Red Mountain Pass, Sneffels Range, and La Plata Mountains. All these areas picked up around a foot of new snow throughout the storm. Areas near Wolf Creek Pass, Molas, Coal Bank, and Sangre de Cristos received a maximum of 4""-6"". The snow came in ""right-side-up"" with denser snow on the bottom and lighter snow on the top. This could help make for a good base but also facet quickly under the forecast weather over the next few days.North winds following the storm are strong enough to move snow and build slabs. The good news is there is little hazard on southerly slopes, so the winds will continue to erode and press north slopes while loading new snow onto bare ground. That said, look for and avoid cross-loaded areas and be wary of stiff surfaces on north slopes.On many slopes, the new snow falls on bare ground, and there isn't enough snow depth to worry about avalanches. The exception is high northerly-facing slopes and gullies that held early-season snow for most of November. On these slopes, weak faceted snow sits below the recent snowfall. You can trigger avalanches on steep slopes where you find more than six inches of fresh snow with old snow below. If you are out recreating on snow and find a nice snow-covered slope, dig down to see what is under the blanket of white. Avoid traveling on slopes if you find weak snow under a freshly built slab. In the parts of the forecast area that picked up around a foot of snow, the avalanche hazard and size of the avalanche you can trigger are more significant than in areas that only picked up a few inches from this past storm.Tuesday, looks like the return of warm and dry weather, which will continue into the Thanksgiving holiday before snow returns for the end of the week and into the weekend.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ian Fowler,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,Copy of Central Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Central Mountains Regional DiscussionA decent, and much-welcomed, storm brought 8 to 12 inches of storm snow to the Grand Mesa and Elk Mountains. This new load brought with it an uptick in the size of avalanches and a change of problem from Wind Slab to Persistent Slab avalanches. In the Elk Mountains, there is a  facet crust combination that formed during warm clear weather earlier in the month and is now buried under about 1 foot of storm snow.  Observers in Marble and close to Aspen have recently reported larger avalanches with propagation across whole terrain features. The crust is supporting the weight of the new snow and allows wide propagation with the weak facets above and below despite a relatively soft slab above. This change is the reason we made the problem switch to Persistent Slab avalanches. Let's all hope they don’t stay with us for the rest of the season. As the slab gains more strength and continuity we can expect to start seeing avalanches being triggered from below and remotely. This problem can not be managed through ski cuts or simple assessment of the snow surface as they can potentially break well above you.  The rest of the Central Mountains only picked up 1 to 4 inches of snow and had less continuous snow coverage prior to the storm. Here you can still find isolated wind-drifted slabs in the alpine, but most slopes are safe from avalanches due to discontinuous snow coverage. Northerly winds over the next few days will further reduce these slabs on northerly aspects and drift snow onto dry southerly slopes. The snow in these areas is very weak so once we finally get a decent storm laying down a slab the avalanche danger will rise quickly.If you have been observing and documenting this snow coverage considersubmitting an observation to us even if it is just a short description of the area and a few images!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
