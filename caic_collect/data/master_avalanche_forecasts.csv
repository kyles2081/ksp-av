The few areas where you may be able to trigger an avalanche are where about one to three inches of new snow from Thursday, accompanied by strong westerly winds, created thin, cohesive slabs of snow on top of weak October snow. Identify and avoid wind-loaded slopes to reduce your chances of triggering a small but potentially dangerous avalanche. You are most likely to encounter these wind-loaded slopes on the lee sides of a ridgeline or in a northerly or easterly-facing gully or couloir where the snow has a hard, hollow feel to it.",,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1

Chris Bilbrey,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Southern Mountains Regional Forecast,,"Southern Mountains Regional DiscussionOn Thursday, mountain snow showers broke up the steady string of bluebird skies, but did little to change current avalanche conditions. Emerson said…”adopt the pace of nature, her secret is patience”. Backcountry enthusiast hoping for notable change to snow conditions have to wait a tad bit longer. The next shot at meaningful snowfall arrives Saturday afternoon, and places in the San Juan Mountains that do well on southwest flow could see eight or more inches of total snow by Sunday. If this scenario plays out, the avalanche danger could rise to Moderate (2of5) above treeline on slopes where weak, early-season snow lingers.So far this season, we have no reports of avalanche activity in the Southern Mountains. Limited snow cover coincides with little avalanche hazard. Areas near Red Mountain Pass, in the Sneffels Range, and near Ophir have received more snow than areas south of Silverton along US 550, in the La Plata Mountains, near Wolf Creek Pass, and Sangre de Cristo Range. Even in the deepest snowfall areas, the snowpack is thin and discontinuous even on shady slopes. Sunny slopes have mostly melted to bare ground.If you were to find a slope with continuous snow cover, an avalanche you trigger would likely be small. Places that harbor wind-drifted snow over weak, faceted snow may exist on high-elevation, northerly aspects. Weather hiking, hunting, or in search of early-season turns, use caution in steeper terrain where even a small avalanche can lead to a rough, nasty ride over shallowly-buried obstacles.Remember, what snow persist on slopes is rapidly losing cohesion and becoming a weak layer of the future. As we prepare for a change to more wintry weather, noting where the snow has collected and what slopes are bare ground will help you stay ahead of the avalanche curve once winter arrives and the snowpack gains depth. Until then, burn a pair of old skis for Ullr or wash your vehicle to help make it snow.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Elsewhere in the North, the danger remains LOW (Level 1 of 5).On high-elevation northerly and some east-facing slopes, weak, faceted snow is still left from October and early November storms. In some places, there are thin slabs of denser, drifted snow above the weak, faceted snow. Whether the surface is soft or hard, the snowpack structure is poor. New snow is drifting and forming slabs that are resting on this poorly structured snowpack. This combination is a recipe for avalanches. You are most likely to trigger an avalanche where October weak layers got buried on Thursday. Thankfully, the weak, old snow is not continuous across the slope. While this should keep the avalanche size small, keep in mind that any ride in an avalanche will likely result in being carried over rocks or other obstacles at this time.The weather breaks on Friday as the next storm starts to make its way to our area Saturday night. No additional precipitation is expected Friday and the danger may briefly go back down to LOW (Level 1 of 5) in the Park Range on Saturday. Any drop in danger will be short-lived as the next system begins to affect the Northern Mountains beginning Saturday night though Monday.

The highest portions of the Grand Mesa and Frying Pan as well as portions of the Sawatch saw up to one or two inches of snow while portions of the Elk and West Elk Mountains picked up about two to four inches of snow. Accompanied by some strong west-to-southwest winds, Thursday's storm did little to change the avalanche danger as not enough snow fell to develop any sort of slab aside from some isolated, wind-loaded terrain features. By avoiding traveling on the lee sides of ridgelines at the top of the slope or in cross-loaded gullies and couloirs, or any other typical wind-loaded terrain features, you can drastically reduce your chances of triggering an avalanche. Any avalanche you trigger will likely be small but they can still take you for a rocky, dangerous ride and entrain any old snow from October growing slightly bigger than you might expect.Tomorrow will be another dry November day across the Central Mountains but this weekend our next storm arrives. Snowfall should start across most of the region on Saturday, increasing in intensity on Sunday. By Monday, favored areas in the West Elks, Elks, and Grand Mesa may see over a foot of total snow. Once we reach about 10 to 12 inches of snow you will see the avalanche danger increase quickly. There is a well-developed weak layer from our October snow storms on most northwest, north, and northeast slopes as well as some high-elevation east and southeast-facing slopes. Once enough snow falls to create a slab on this weak layer you can expect it to be very easy to trigger avalanches on any slopes that had continuous snow coverage prior to Thursday’s snowfall. It is far too early to tell what the winter season will bring, but we know once we get enough snow to develop a slab it will bring several days to several weeks of heightened to dangerous avalanche conditions across a great deal of the Central Mountains.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The storm starts on a southwest flow shifting to the west promoting a zonal flow that favors the Elk and West Elk Mountains before shifting to the northwest later in the day on Sunday. This storm will start warm under a southwest flow then a cold front arrive Sunday afternoon as the flow shifts northwest quickly decreasing temperatures. This “right-side-up” storm will start warm with wet, dense snow and as temperatures decrease the snow will become colder and less dense. Normally this is a good thing as it decreases the chances for Storm Slab avalanches to develop into a major issue. In this case, the snow will quickly develop into a slab with a dense base on top of an incredibly weak snowpack on almost every slope that holds continuous snow. The weak base to the snowpack from all of our October snow has been rotting under dry weather, low relative humidity, and cold, clear nights for the first half of November. Once a slab develops on this weak layer you can expect it to be very easy to trigger avalanches. The only reason the avalanche danger remains at Moderate (Level 2 of 5) is because the size of these avalanches will likely remain small until the slab builds up quite a bit more.Hopefully, avid backcountry travelers have been taking note of slopes that currently have continuous snow coverage across them. These slopes will be the most dangerous in the coming days as a slab develops on top of an already well-developed weak layer.

Favored areas should see about 10 inches of snow with most areas in the four to eight inch range by Monday evening. Snow starts Saturday night in favored areas and lasts through Monday across the region. The Park Range, and to a lesser extent the Flat Tops, are still forecast to be the big winners with this storm and should see most of their accumulation on the front end of this system. Areas further to the east, like the Front Range and Summit County, see more intense snowfall on Sunday and Sunday night as the wind shifts to the north.In areas where snow begins tonight, like the Park Range and Flat Tops, the danger increases to MODERATE (Level 2 of 5) on Sunday. Across the Northern Mountains, snow is falling on weak, faceted snow from October and early November that was left on high-elevation northerly and east-facing slopes. Westerly winds will drift the new snow onto this weak base and avalanche conditions will become more dangerous quickly. Thankfully, the weak, old snow was generally confined to gully features and just below ridgelines was not very continuous across the slope. This should keep the overall avalanche size small and it is unlikely we’ll see enough snow to move beyond MODERATE (Level 2 of 5) danger.In the rest of the Northern Mountains, peak snowfall is focused more on Sunday and Sunday night. While snow totals likely won’t be high enough to raise the avalanche danger, we may add a Wind Slab avalanche problem given a widespread few inches of snow with wind. The Flat Tops may fall into this lower danger category, check back tomorrow morning to see if that area stays with the Park Range or joins the rest of the Northern Mountains. If tomorrow’s forecasts begin to increase totals for the rest of the Northern Mountains, there may be a bump in danger on Monday - although this scenario seems unlikely at this time. Areas like Cameron Pass and the Gore Range are the most likely places to see higher totals than the rest of the Front Range and Summit County areas.Keep in mind that there are still early-season conditions in the Northern Mountains and any ride in an avalanche will likely result in being carried over rocks or other obstacles.

Austin Divesta,2023-11-20T23:30:00Z,Northern Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Northern Mountains Regional DiscussionOver the weekend, a storm hit the region, but it moved out on Monday. The Northern Mountains welcomed a sign of winter. However, most areas needed more snow to change the avalanche danger. Cameron Pass through Berthoud Pass to the Ten Mile Range received between two to six inches of snow, and the avalanche danger remains LOW in these areas. On the other hand, the Park Range received between eight to twelve inches of snow, and the new snow and winds created drifted snow at upper elevations on northerly and east-facing slopes, heightening the avalanche danger toCurrently, high-elevation northerlies and east-facing slopes are presenting problems due to the snow that has been accumulating since October and early November. The warm daytime temperatures of the last two weeks and cold nights created a faceted layer of snow. In the largest cluster of the Northern Mountains stretching from Cameron Pass through Berthoud Pass to the Ten Mile Range, more than the two to six inches of new snow was needed to create a widespread problem. However, there are still a few places that may pose a problem. Observers reported problematic slopes around Rocky Mountain National Park and Jones Pass over the weekend. These terrain features are located along the lee sides of ridges, gullies, couloirs, or avalanche chutes. It's worth noting that Wind Slab avalanches have also been added to this region but are still difficult to trigger.The story is similar to the Park Range, with northerly and east-facing slopes being the most problematic due to the lack of snow in November with the warm days and cold nights. The only difference is the amount of snow they receive over the weekend. The sheer amount of new snow and winds will more easily overload the weak layer, creating a more sensitive trigger for avalanches. These avalanches may still be small, but consider the consequences of the terrain below. Much of the near and below treeline terrain around the Park Range does not have snow on the ground or only a few inches.Outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy activities like hunting, hiking, ice climbing, or sliding on snow should be mindful of the risk of avalanches in their recreational areas. If you notice that the snow starts to support your weight and sounds hollow, you likely stumbled upon a problematic area. Even a small avalanche can have severe consequences.

Precipitation intensity picked up on Sunday afternoon and continued into Monday. The heaviest snowfall for most of the forecast area was sundown Sunday into Monday morning. Snowfall favored areas around Telluride, Red Mountain Pass, Sneffels Range, and La Plata Mountains. All these areas picked up around a foot of new snow throughout the storm. Areas near Wolf Creek Pass, Molas, Coal Bank, and Sangre de Cristos received a maximum of 4""-6"". The snow came in ""right-side-up"" with denser snow on the bottom and lighter snow on the top. This could help make for a good base but also facet quickly under the forecast weather over the next few days.North winds following the storm are strong enough to move snow and build slabs. The good news is there is little hazard on southerly slopes, so the winds will continue to erode and press north slopes while loading new snow onto bare ground. That said, look for and avoid cross-loaded areas and be wary of stiff surfaces on north slopes.On many slopes, the new snow falls on bare ground, and there isn't enough snow depth to worry about avalanches. The exception is high northerly-facing slopes and gullies that held early-season snow for most of November. On these slopes, weak faceted snow sits below the recent snowfall. You can trigger avalanches on steep slopes where you find more than six inches of fresh snow with old snow below. If you are out recreating on snow and find a nice snow-covered slope, dig down to see what is under the blanket of white. Avoid traveling on slopes if you find weak snow under a freshly built slab. In the parts of the forecast area that picked up around a foot of snow, the avalanche hazard and size of the avalanche you can trigger are more significant than in areas that only picked up a few inches from this past storm.Tuesday, looks like the return of warm and dry weather, which will continue into the Thanksgiving holiday before snow returns for the end of the week and into the weekend.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This new load brought with it an uptick in the size of avalanches and a change of problem from Wind Slab to Persistent Slab avalanches. In the Elk Mountains, there is a  facet crust combination that formed during warm clear weather earlier in the month and is now buried under about 1 foot of storm snow.  Observers in Marble and close to Aspen have recently reported larger avalanches with propagation across whole terrain features. The crust is supporting the weight of the new snow and allows wide propagation with the weak facets above and below despite a relatively soft slab above. This change is the reason we made the problem switch to Persistent Slab avalanches. Let's all hope they don’t stay with us for the rest of the season. As the slab gains more strength and continuity we can expect to start seeing avalanches being triggered from below and remotely. This problem can not be managed through ski cuts or simple assessment of the snow surface as they can potentially break well above you.  The rest of the Central Mountains only picked up 1 to 4 inches of snow and had less continuous snow coverage prior to the storm. Here you can still find isolated wind-drifted slabs in the alpine, but most slopes are safe from avalanches due to discontinuous snow coverage. Northerly winds over the next few days will further reduce these slabs on northerly aspects and drift snow onto dry southerly slopes.
